## **_Description_**

A 1 or 2 player game consisting of a game board, red chips (player 1), yellow chips (player 2/computer), and a score tracker.

## **_How to Get Started_**

Each player takes turns dropping their chips onto the game board. You can drop a chip on the board by clicking the button above the designated slot on the game board. A player wins when they get 4 game chips in a row in either a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal direction.
